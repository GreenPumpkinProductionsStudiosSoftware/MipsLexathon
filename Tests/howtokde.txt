~~How to KDE:~~
the KDE appears to uses four memory addresses to do it's job: 0xffff0000, 0xffff0004,
0xfff0008, and xffff000c.

0xffff0000 and 0xffff0004 are used for the keyboard emulator. 0xffff0004 contains the code of the
key pressed. 0xffff0000 contains the ready bit (the lowest place, ...0001) and the interrupt-enable
bit (the second to lowest place, ...0010). The interrupt-enable bit is zero by default, and you
have to set it to one using a store operation.
The ready bit is set to one every time a key is pressed and set to zero every time an instruction
like lw or lb reads the content of 0xffff0004.
If the ready bit is one, the interrupt-enable bit is one, and the first bit of coprocessor0
regsiter
$12 is one, then MARS initiates an interrupt, where it will look for kernel mode instructions at
0x80000180 (why there? because that is the way MARS was written). it will then run whatever
instructions are there, which have presumably been written to
deal with an interrupt.

0xffff000c and 0xffff0008 are used for the display emulator. Their functions mirror the two keyboard
emulator addresses. 0xffff0008 contains the display's ready bit, which is set set to zero when data
is stored in 0xffff000c using an operation such as sw or sb. It is then set back to one after the
character in 0xffff000c is put on the display, which occurs after a delay that the user can set in
the KDE's dialog.
