Welcome to MIPS Lexathon, the intense word-based puzzle game only for Linux!

MIPS Lexathon runs exclusively on linux based operating systems. It has not been tested with
OracleJDK for linux; OpenJDK 7 is preferred. 

To Run:
1. Load the file and select the "Keyboard and Display Simulator" from the "Tools" dropdown menu in
   MARS
2. In the Keyboard and Display Simulator window, adjust the slider labeled "Display Length" until
   the value it reads is 1.
3. In the Keyboard and Display Simulator window, press "Connect to MIPS"
4. Set the run speed to max.
5. Assemble and Run.

The program should take a minute or two to load, depending on the speed of your computer. When
complete the puzzle should display in the top box of the Keyboard and Display Simulator. If it seems
to be taking too long, disconnect and reconnect the Keyboard and Display Simulator, select the lower
box in its window, and press enter. If that does not work, try restarting MARS. MARS is very touchy,
but it usually takes only one or two tries to get the program to work properly.

Once the puzzle appears, select the lower box in the Keyboard and display emulator's window and
begin typing input. Once you press enter, the program will clear the input box and submit whatever
you have typed. It will also automatically submit once you have placed in 9 characters. There is no
time limit in MIPS lexathon. Your only objective is to find as many words as you can. Press enter
with no input to shuffle the letters in the puzzle, and type in 'q' to quit.

Have Fun!
